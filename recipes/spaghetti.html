        <li> Combine tomatoes and 1/2 the parsley in a blender; puree until smooth. </li>
        <li> Heat olive oil in a separate pan over medium heat.
             Add onion, bell pepper, and chile pepper; cook and stir until softened, about 5 minutes.<br>
             Add garlic; cook until fragrant but not browned, 1 to 2 minutes. </li>
        <li> Pour pureed tomato mixture into the pan with the peppers. <br>
             Add water, tomato paste, oregano, salt, and black pepper. Stir well; add paprika. <br>
             Let sauce simmer on low to medium heat until juices have reduced.  </li>
        <li> Strain shrimp shells from the water. Bring water back to a boil and add spaghetti. <br>
             Cook spaghetti, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minute. <br>
             Reserve 1 cup of the cooking water and drain the rest. </li>
        <li> In the meantime, add shrimp to the tomato sauce. <br>
